    - Various other fixes and improvements.


\section v210 Changes made from version 2.00 to 2.10:

    - Fixed: Enable could be sent multiple times after a timeout, causing the original packet to be lost.
    - Fixed: Release executable would not load due to missing DLLs if Visual Studio runtime is not installed,
             for example on a clean installation of Windows Vista.
    - Fixed: Crash when sending a canned response text message.
    - Fixed: Log files with lines longer than 529 bytes were not parsed properly.
    - Fixed: Tab order and dialog title on New Stop dialog were incorrect.
    - Fixed: Incorrect threshold angles were used to determine the cardinal direction.
    - Fixed: GPI versions were interpreted by the app as strings instead of arbitrary bytes.
    - Fixed: Resizing the log viewer caused some controls to be moved to incorrect locations.
    - Fixed: Unicode characters in stops and in saved data were not encoded properly.
    - Fixed: Crash in log viewer when the log is empty and the Find button is clicked.
    - Fixed: Crash when receiving a text message ack if the response text is longer than 34 characters.
    - Added: The periodic ETA request can now be turned on or off.
    - Added: A000 (Legacy) product information protocol to get product ID and software version in legacy mode.
    - Added: UNICODE_SUPPORT and MINIMAL_ENABLE preprocessor defines.
    - Added: User can now specify stop ID for A603 stops.
    - Improved: The Select Port dialog now shows all available COM ports.

    - Improved: Known product IDs are now displayed with a descriptive name.
    - Improved: Changed from a timer-driven to an event-driven architecture using Windows messages.
    - Improved: Cleaned up the layout of the New Stop dialog box and improved the description of each protocol.
    - Improved: In the log viewer, the raw payload can be shown as ASCII as well as hex for easier reading.  To enable,

    - Improved: File and directory names longer than 200 characters are handled better.
    - Improved: The Log Viewer now displays the raw packet (10 xx ... xx 10 03) instead of just the FMI payload.
    - Improved: Performance is improved when selecting packets from large log files.
    - Improved: The default log file (fmi_pc_app.log) is not cleared until a com port is selected,
                making it easier to view the log from the previous execution of the program.
    - Technical: All documentation is now generated by Doxygen.
    - Technical: Corrected type of message_type when sending text messages using A604 protocols.
    - Technical: Several class names, method names, and variable names have been renamed for clarity and consistency.
