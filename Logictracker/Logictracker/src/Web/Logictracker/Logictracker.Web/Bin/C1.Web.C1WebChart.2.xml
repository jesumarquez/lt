        <para>
            When chart data is transferred from one page to another, IDs are created for the Session or Cache variables
            or for a filename in order to render a chart image. This property determines whether a unique ID is created
            each time the chart image is accessed (i.e. when the chart image is accessed by a single user),
            or if the same ID is to be used for the duration of the application life (i.e. when the identical chart image
            is accessed by multiple users or accessed repeatedly by a single user).

            The use of Grayscale is intended as a preview for output to a black and white device.  It
            does not affect style brush or pen colors internally, only the rendering of the chart to the
            output devices and images.  Using grayscale implies the use of double buffered output.
