            </summary>
      <remarks>
            When a secondary URL is used to stream image data back to an &lt;IMG&gt; tag on the primary page,
            it is necessary to transfer the chart data through either a session object, cache object, or a file.

            Gets or sets the level of uniqueness of the ID transfer object.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
            When chart data is transferred from one page to another, IDs are created for the Session or Cache variables
            or for a filename in order to render a chart image. This property determines whether a unique ID is created
            each time the chart image is accessed (i.e. when the chart image is accessed by a single user),
            or if the same ID is to be used for the duration of the application life (i.e. when the identical chart image
            is accessed by multiple users or accessed repeatedly by a single user). 
            </para>
        <para>
            Note: The ImageIdGeneration property has no effect with the ImageRenderMethodEnum.File or ImageRenderMethodEnum.BinaryWrite.

            <remarks>
            The use of Grayscale is intended as a preview for output to a black and white device.  It
            does not affect style brush or pen colors internally, only the rendering of the chart to the
            output devices and images.  Using grayscale implies the use of double buffered output.

            The event handler receives an argument of type C1WebChart3DCallbackEventArgs

            Use the client side General callback to pass your own data in string
            form to the server.  Based on the content of your string data, you can change
            any and all aspects of the chart and obtain a new image and image map as a
            result of the callback.
            </para><para>
            The General callback is typically used when a callback from an input object
            on the web page is desired - e.g. a button, onclick.
